# Egill Antonsson website

This repository is where I put the build artifacts for my website [Egill.rocks](https://egill.rocks).

My website is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). Previously I used Github Pages (as the name of this repository implies) but it [currently doesn't support redirects for SPA's](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/408) and needs a hack to fix it, Netlify on the other hand [supports it](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/).

The project where I develop my website is [EgillAntonsson-website](https://github.com/EgillAntonsson/EgillAntonsson-website)
